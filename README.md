<h1>best Thing About About Soundness Labs</h1>

<h2> 1💠Core Mission:</h2> 
Soundness Labs is building a "Sound Internet" by creating a decentralized verification layer that secures data, rewards user actions, and enables trustless value flows using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs and cryptography, enhancing privacy and verifiability across web3 and beyond.

<h2> 2💠Soundness Layer Overview:</h2> 
The flagship product is the Soundness Layer, a proof-agnostic decentralized verification system that handles heavy ZK computations off-chain for low latency, high throughput, and cross-chain compatibility, addressing Ethereum's gas limits for scalable proof verification.

<h2> 3💠Blockchain Infrastructure:</h2> 
Built on Sui for efficient sequencing and Walrus for decentralized data availability and storage, enabling cost-effective proof handling—recently reduced gas costs per GB by 10x via Quilt integration.

<h2> 4💠Post-Quantum Security Focus:</h2>
Pioneers quantum-resistant tech, achieving the first fully post-quantum (PQ) secure NIZK proof attested on-chain using Falcon signatures (NIST-standard), with over 20k such proofs verified to protect against emerging quantum threats.

<h2> 5💠Key Partnerships:</h2> 
Collaborates with Succinct Labs for SP1 zkVM integration on Sui (lowering dev barriers for ZK apps), Walrus Protocol for storage, Ligero Inc. for proof generation, and Sui Network for ecosystem growth.

<h2> 6💠Ecosystem Milestones: </h2>
As of October 2025, generated over 800k ZK proofs total, stored 400k+ on Walrus, with 229 active community games and 54k+ participants—dashboard tracks real-time metrics like attestations and game activity.
